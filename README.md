Hi! I'm a 5th year undergaduate student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I'm currently working on my thesis on Dueling Bandits, Fairness in Bandit Problems and Non-Stationary Bandit Problems with Dimitris Fotakis and Chara Podimata. In September I will be joining Archimedes Unit/Athena Research Center as a PhD student.
My research interests include Online Learning, Bandit Problems and AGT (Mechanism Design).
